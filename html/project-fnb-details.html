                    <h2>1. Context & Challenge</h2>
                    <p>As participants in G'Contest 2025's intense "Sales Analytics" challenge, our team faced a critical task: to decode the post-COVID performance of Vietnam's dynamic Food & Beverage sector. We were tasked with <strong>transforming raw financial statements into actionable insights</strong>, aiming to guide strategic business development decisions amidst industry recovery. This project served as a direct, real-world application of advanced data analytics.</p>

                    <h2>2. Data Acquisition & Processing Journey</h2>
                    <p>My primary contribution involved <strong>transforming complex, disparate raw financial data</strong> into a clean, analytical-ready dataset and deriving key performance indicators. This journey presented significant challenges and required a hybrid approach:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Raw Data Source:</strong> We began with raw Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow Statements for Vietnamese F&B enterprises from 2019-2023, initially provided in Excel format. This data often contained inconsistencies, missing values, and varying formats.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Leveraging Hybrid Power (Python & Excel):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I utilized <strong>Python (Pandas & NumPy)</strong> within Jupyter Notebook for efficient, large-scale data integration, initial cleaning, and structured transformation. This included automating the handling of diverse non-numeric entries, standardizing formats, and ensuring overall data integrity across thousands of financial records.</li>
                                <li><strong>Microsoft Excel</strong> was employed in parallel for meticulous, step-by-step calculation and cross-validation of specific, complex financial ratios. This <strong>dual-tool approach</strong> ensured both scalability and granular precision in our derived metrics.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Strategic Missing Data Management:</strong> Rather than simply removing incomplete entries, I implemented a <strong>nuanced strategy for missing values</strong>. Core financial metrics with minimal missing data were retained as NaN (reflecting true absence), while highly sparse columns (e.g., >80% missing) were identified and prudently excluded from broad aggregate analysis to preserve representativeness.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Unlocking Insights through Feature Engineering:</strong> From the meticulously prepared dataset, I engineered a comprehensive suite of financial and operational metrics. These were vital in assessing performance from multiple angles:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Profitability: Gross, Operating, Pre-tax, and Net Profit Margins.</li>
                                <li>Growth: Year-over-Year (YoY) Revenue Growth, Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).</li>
                                <li>Efficiency: Total Asset Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Accounts Receivable Turnover.</li>
                                <li>Financial Health: Debt-to-Asset, Debt-to-Equity, Current, and Quick Ratios.</li>
                                <li>Return on Investment: ROA, ROE.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This rigorous process ensured our subsequent analysis was built on a solid foundation of relevant, accurate, and insightful indicators.</p>

                    <h2>3. Analytical Approach & Key Discoveries</h2>
                    <p>Our analysis unfolded in <strong>three strategic layers</strong>, as mandated by the competition's Sales Analytics framework:</p>

                    <h3>A. Descriptive Analytics – Unveiling Industry Trends & Segmentation</h3>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-industry"></i> Industry Overview (2019-2023)</h4>
                    <p>The Vietnamese F&B industry faced immense challenges from 2019-2023, particularly due to COVID-19. Total Net Revenue peaked in 2019 (<strong>~30 Trillion VND</strong>) before experiencing a significant decline in 2020 and 2021 (due to lockdowns and travel restrictions). Crucially, the industry showed a strong recovery from 2022 onwards, with Net Revenue surpassing 2019 levels by 2023 (<strong>~35 Trillion VND</strong>). Gross Profit followed similar trends, while Profit Before Tax and Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities were severely impacted, turning <strong>negative in 2020-2021</strong>, but recovered to <strong>positive levels in 2022-2023</strong>, indicating improved core operational cash generation.</p>

                    <p><strong>→ Insight:</strong> The F&B sector demonstrated remarkable resilience, rapidly bouncing back from the pandemic's direct impacts.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Performance Comparison by Business Size</h4>
                    <p>By segmenting companies into Large, Medium, and Small enterprises (based on 2019 Net Revenue), we identified a clear pattern: <strong>Enterprise size significantly influenced resilience and recovery capacity</strong> post-pandemic.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Large Enterprises:</strong> Experienced sharp declines in 2020-2021 but demonstrated rapid revenue recovery by 2022, often surpassing pre-pandemic levels. They also maintained the best profit margins during challenging periods, showcasing greater operational stability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium Enterprises:</strong> Showed similar trends to Large enterprises but with a milder amplitude. Their profit margins fluctuated most significantly in 2021, suggesting a more sensitive response to market changes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Small Enterprises:</strong> Maintained consistently lower revenue levels and, while showing the highest growth rate in 2023 (likely from a very low base), their profit margins were <strong>deeply negative</strong> and showed limited recovery, highlighting systemic vulnerabilities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>→ Insight:</strong> Larger businesses possessed inherent advantages in navigating and recovering from market disruptions, signaling varied investment and support needs across segments.</p>

                    <h3>B. Diagnostic Analytics – Pinpointing Performance Drivers & Identifying Targets</h3>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-search-dollar"></i> Growth Rate & Cash Flow Trends</h4>
                    <p>Analysis of median Revenue Growth (YoY) revealed a deep decline (2020-2021) followed by a <strong>sharp recovery (2022)</strong> and stabilization (2023). This trend strongly correlated with Total Operating Cash Flow, which also shifted from <strong>negative (2020-2021) to positive (2022-2023)</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>→ Insight:</strong> This direct correlation underscores that cash flow closely mirrored operational performance through the crisis and recovery cycles, indicating healthy operational fund generation post-pandemic.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave"></i> Cost Analysis & Profitability Drivers</h4>
                    <p>While Selling Expenses and G&A Expenses increased in absolute value, their ratios to revenue showed a slight decrease (Selling Expenses) or stabilization/slight increase (G&A Expenses) post-crisis. Meanwhile, the ratio of Cost of Goods Sold/Revenue decreased, leading to an <strong>improved Gross Profit margin</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>→ Insight:</strong> Effective control over operating costs (Selling, G&A) and improving cost of goods sold efficiency were crucial factors enabling the industry's final profit recovery, demonstrating improved operational management.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Target Business Group Identification</h4>
                    <p>Based on stringent criteria (growth rates, profit, and stability), we precisely segmented companies into two distinct, actionable groups:</p>

                    <h5></i> "High-Potential for Expansion" Group (~250 businesses)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Demonstrated <strong>superior post-COVID recovery and growth</strong> (average CAGR > 50% from 2022)</li>
                        <li>Maintained relative stability throughout the volatile period (overall CAGR from 2019 not declining by more than 150%)</li>
                        <li>Achieved <strong>positive Net Profit</strong> from Business Activities in the most recent year, indicating robust profitability from core operations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5></i> "Requiring Operational Improvement" Group (~1000 businesses)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Suffered <strong>sustained losses</strong> (negative Net Profit from Business Activities in the most recent year)</li>
                        <li>Experienced <strong>severe post-COVID revenue decline</strong> (CAGR from 2022 negative by > 200% per year)</li>
                        <li>Showed prolonged and extremely severe revenue decline (overall CAGR from 2019 negative by > 500% per year)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>→ Key Insight:</strong> This precise segmentation allowed for data-driven differentiation. The "High-Potential" group exhibited an <strong>average post-COVID CAGR over 30%</strong>, whereas the "Requiring Support" group showed <strong>almost no growth</strong>, highlighting vastly different needs for intervention.</p>

                    <h3>C. Prescriptive Analytics – Crafting Actionable Strategies</h3>
                    <p>Drawing from our data-driven classifications, we developed tailored strategic recommendations to optimize outcomes for each identified business group:</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Recommendations for "Requiring Operational Improvement" Group</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Optimize Operating Costs:</strong> Review and cut ineffective costs (especially Selling & G&A expenses), focusing on high-impact channels/activities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhance Sales & Revenue Efficiency:</strong> Re-evaluate pricing and product strategies, strengthen promising sales channels (e.g., online, delivery), and invest in targeted marketing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improve Cash Flow Management:</strong> Accelerate customer collections, renegotiate supplier terms, and seek emergency working capital.</li>
                        <li><strong>Re-evaluate Business Model:</strong> Assess the current model's suitability for the post-COVID market and consider fundamental changes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seek Specialized Consulting:</strong> Engage with business support organizations for financial management, business strategy, and marketing advice.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Strategies for "High-Potential for Expansion" Group</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Expand Physical Network/Scale:</strong> Open new branches in promising geographic areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Develop New Products/Services:</strong> Invest in R&D to diversify offerings and enhance customer experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adopt Technology:</strong> Invest in supply chain management, CRM, and customer data analytics for operational optimization and growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider Franchising Model:</strong> If the business model is standardized and successful, franchising can be a rapid expansion method.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expand Distribution Channels:</strong> Further boost online channels and collaborate with major delivery/e-commerce platforms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capital Mobilization for Expansion:</strong> Leverage internal cash flow or seek external funding (bank loans, investments) given a healthy financial profile.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2></i> 4. Key Insights & Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The overall Vietnam F&B industry demonstrated <strong>remarkable resilience and recovered significantly</strong> from the the 2020-2021 COVID-19 shock, with a strong rebound in revenue, profit, and cash flow from 2022. However, this recovery was <strong>uneven, with significant disparities</strong> in performance among businesses. Our rigorous analysis effectively identified distinct groups of businesses: those poised for significant expansion and those critically needing operational intervention. This underscores the vital importance of <strong>data-driven, tailored strategies</strong> based on individual business health and growth trajectory, moving beyond generalized industry observations.</p>

                    <h2></i> 5. Lessons Learned & Future Work</h2>
                    <p>This project significantly reinforced the importance of <strong>granular data analysis</strong> in understanding complex industry dynamics beyond aggregate trends. It highlighted how even within a recovering sector, businesses can diverge drastically, necessitating differentiated strategic interventions. My experience sharpened my technical skills in both Python and Excel for data manipulation, and deepened my understanding of translating complex financial data into compelling, actionable business narratives.</p>

                    <p><strong>Contest Performance Reflection:</strong> Achieving a score of <strong>80/100 in Round 2</strong> of the G'Contest 2025 validates the effectiveness of our analytical approach and insights. While we did not advance, the valuable feedback received highlighted areas for further enhancement in data storytelling and strengthening the evidence base for recommendations – areas I am actively committed to improving and developing further.</p>
